## Personal Finance Simulator

I want to be able to simulate and compare a number of different scenarios involving property transactions, mortgages, etc.

Most mortgage calculators, etc tend to focus on monthly cash-flow, but I'm more interested in the overall cost of various options i.e. taking a longer term view.

Also I want to play with some non-Rails Ruby code and a strongly OO approach.
